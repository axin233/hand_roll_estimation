# Hand roll estimation via deep-learning-based computer vision algorithms
This is the repository for the hand roll estimation algorithms. 

In a medical examination called Fundamental of Vascular Surgery, participants' skill levels can be identified by the rotation at the roll axis (i.e., hand roll). This repository shows that participant's hand roll angles can be estimated by video processing.
